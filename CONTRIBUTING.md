## üìè Contribution Guidelines

### Branch Naming Convention
Use descriptive branch names with prefixes:
- `feature/add-webhook-filtering`
- `bugfix/fix-delivery-retry-logic`
- `docs/update-api-documentation`
- `refactor/optimize-database-queries`
- `test/add-endpoint-validation-tests`

### Commit Message Format
We use conventional commits for clear history:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Adding tests
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(endpoints): add endpoint filtering by status

Add ability to filter endpoints by active/inactive status
in the dashboard view.

Closes #123

fix(delivery): resolve retry logic infinite loop

The retry mechanism was getting stuck in an infinite loop
when the endpoint returned a 500 status. Added proper
backoff logic and maximum retry limits.

Fixes #456
```

## üé® Code Style & Standards

### PHP (Laravel) Standards
We follow PSR-12 coding standards with some project-specific rules:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Services;

use App\Models\Endpoint;
use App\Models\Event;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http;

class WebhookDeliveryService
{
    public function deliver(Event $event, Endpoint $endpoint): bool
    {
        $payload = $this->preparePayload($event);
        
        $response = Http::timeout(30)
            ->withHeaders($this->getHeaders($endpoint))
            ->post($endpoint->url, $payload);
            
        return $response->successful();
    }
    
    private function preparePayload(Event $event): array
    {
        return [
            'event_type' => $event->event_type,
            'payload' => $event->payload,
            'timestamp' => $event->created_at->toISOString(),
        ];
    }
}
```

### Vue.js/JavaScript Standards
We use ESLint with Vue.js best practices:

```vue
<template>
  <div class="webhook-endpoint">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">
      {{ endpoint.name }}
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600">
      {{ endpoint.description }}
    </p>
    <button 
      @click="toggleStatus"
      class="btn"
      :class="endpoint.is_active ? 'btn-success' : 'btn-warning'"
    >
      {{ endpoint.is_active ? 'Active' : 'Inactive' }}
    </button>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { computed } from 'vue'
import { router } from '@inertiajs/vue3'

const props = defineProps({
  endpoint: {
    type: Object,
    required: true
  }
})

const toggleStatus = () => {
  router.patch(`/endpoints/${props.endpoint.id}`, {
    is_active: !props.endpoint.is_active
  })
}
</script>
```

### Database Standards
- Use descriptive table and column names
- Follow Laravel naming conventions
- Add proper indexes for performance
- Include foreign key constraints
- Write reversible migrations

### API Standards
- Follow RESTful principles
- Use consistent response formats
- Include proper status codes
- Validate all inputs
- Document all endpoints

## üß™ Testing Requirements

All contributions must include appropriate tests:

### Required Test Coverage
- **New features**: Must include feature tests
- **Bug fixes**: Must include regression tests
- **API changes**: Must include API tests
- **Models**: Must include unit tests

### Writing Tests
```php
// Feature Test Example
class WebhookDeliveryTest extends TestCase
{
    use RefreshDatabase;
    
    public function test_successful_webhook_delivery()
    {
        // Arrange
        $user = User::factory()->create();
        $endpoint = Endpoint::factory()->for($user)->create();
        $event = Event::factory()->for($user)->create();
        
        // Mock external HTTP call
        Http::fake([
            $endpoint->url => Http::response(['status' => 'ok'], 200)
        ]);
        
        // Act
        $delivery = app(WebhookDeliveryService::class)
            ->deliver($event, $endpoint);
            
        // Assert
        $this->assertTrue($delivery);
        $this->assertDatabaseHas('deliveries', [
            'event_id' => $event->id,
            'endpoint_id' => $endpoint->id,
            'status' => 'success'
        ]);
    }
}
```
